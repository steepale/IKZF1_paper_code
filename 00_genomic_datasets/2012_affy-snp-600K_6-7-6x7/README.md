# Commercial Affymetrix SNP Chips (~600K) in Uninfected *Gallus gallus* Avian Disease and Oncology Lab (ADOL) Lines 6, 7, & 6x7 F1.

Twelve experimental layers (three line 6, three line 7, and six line 6x7 F1) underwent analysis with commercial chicken-genome-wide 600K Affymetrix SNP arrays. Whole genomic DNA was isolated from blood and prepared at ADOL. DNA were processed and genotyped by DNA LandMarks (Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, Canada) in 2012. From the over 560K calls, about 157K were informative between lines 6 and 7 and about 146K SNPs were completely fixed between the two lines.
