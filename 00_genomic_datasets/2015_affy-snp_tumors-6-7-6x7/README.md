# Custom Affymetrix SNP Chips (~15K) in *Gallus gallus* and Marek's Disease (MD) Lymphomas 

Approximately 13,665 SNP loci were measured in 72 Marek's disease tumors, line 6 DNA, line 7 DNA, and F1 6x7 DNA via custom Affymetrix SNP chips. DNA was prepared at the Avian Disease and Oncology Lab and provided as a 96 well plate. SNP arrays were processed and genotyped by DNA LandMarks (Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, Canada).
